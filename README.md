a simple URL to .mp4 to .wav to .md transcription tool using openAI whisper + yt-dlp

first project in the books. all of my planning never prepared me to deal with version control and adapting to using git. it feels like such an easy concept but im so awful. same with using the terminal. the python itself was curated with like 90% LLM help and debugging seemed pretty intuitive for me (for now since code is ez lol)

anyways, this is like 1/405 projects i want to do but i consume to many youtube long-form to not have transcriptions for my note-taking system

v2 of this will bring in some further optimations to make this just a single line of code to run hopefully
